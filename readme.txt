Add a guestbook site which uses the wordpress integrated comments.


== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to add a guestbook site which uses the wordpress integrated comments. Simply insert the shortcode [comment-guestbook] into a page to enable this plugin. Find a detailed description and some options to modify the output on the admin page under Comments -> Guestbook.

This is a very early version of this plugin, so the options to modify the output are very limited in this version.


== Installation ==

The easiest version of installing is to go to the admin page. There you can install new plugins in the menu Plugins -> Add new. Search for "Comment Guestbook" and press "Install now".

If you want to install the plugin manually download the zip-file and extract the files in your wp-content/plugins folder.
